# [Create a Responsive Website Using HTML5 and CSS3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOG90Q8EfRo)

Rewritten from the YouTube tutorial by 1stWebDesigner, published on March 16, 2013.

## Notes on the Original

### `<content>` Tag

[`<content>`: The Shadow DOM Content Placeholder element (obsolete)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/content) reveals that the `<content>` tag is not only deprecated, but was not ever what 1stWebDesigner seemed to think it was. He used it as a kind of `<div>` or sub-`<article>` tag, but it seems to have been a draft tag for webapps using Web Components.

I wish that I had recognized it's fishiness instinctively, but really I googled it because VSCode didn't recognize the tag.

Unfamiliar topics: Shadow DOM, Web Components, `<slot>`

## Changes for the Rewrite

### Flexbox and CSS Grid

After watching [Making Future Interfaces: Algorithmic Layouts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOUtkN6M52M) by Heydon Pickering, I am both charmed and going to use the Flexbox sidebar layout he describes, but switching the right-hand side to be the sidebar that goes under.

Rather than using CSS Grid for this simple layout, I'll practice Flexbox and save Grid practice for some more complex or experimental layout.
